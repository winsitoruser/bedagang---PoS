# Anatomy Images

Please place the body organ systems image as `body-organ-systems.png` in this directory.

The image should show:
- Male body organ systems (top row): Integumentary, Muscular, Skeletal, Lymphatic, Nervous, Circulatory, Reproductive, Respiratory, Endocrine, Digestive, Urinary
- Female body organ systems (bottom row): Same systems as male

The interactive anatomy viewer will use this image to create clickable regions for each organ system.
